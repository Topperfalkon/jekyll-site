          <h2>Pirate Party Principles</h2>
          <p>The Pirate Party in the UK adopted a set of seven principles on which its policies are based.
            All the policies and ideas you see here, as well as the stances we take in our advocacy, local or national campaigning, 
            come from these seven principles. They determine whether we can or cannot support a specific initiative and they should be sufficient 
            to determine our position on any number of issues, whether outlined in our manifesto or additional policy documents or not:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Sharing</strong> – Our society is built upon the sharing of knowledge, ideas and culture. It is furthered by freedom of thought and expression, and protected
            by the rule of law. The Pirate Party exists to ensure the preservation and development of these foundations.</li>
            <li><strong>Security</strong> - To ensure the security of our society it is the responsibility of the government to provide for its defence, the mechanisms
            of justice and such services and infrastructure requireds to meet its needs.</li>
            <li><strong>Equal</strong> - All are equal under the law. We all have a say in the structure and processes of governance and a right to know what is done on our behalf.</li>
            <li><strong>Evidence</strong> - We will act on the basis of evidence, with the consent of society through democracy in the interests of all.</li>
            <li><strong>Participation</strong> - To be free to participate in society everyone must have access to justice, education and such services and infrastructure required for life within it.</li>
            <li><strong>Respect</strong> - Respect for our private and family life by government and society is fundamental and we all have freedom of choice in our associations and relationships.</li>
            <li><strong>Dignity</strong> - Human Dignity is inviolable. Each of us has a right to life and to live, to freedom of thought and self determination, and to participarte in society.</li>
          </ul>
